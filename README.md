# Running it
Windows Users will find builds attached to the releases above.
Those with another OS will need to build it themselves

``` bash
git clone http://github.com/flxw/scplay /tmp/scplay
cd /tmp/folienizer
qmake
make
```

# Usage
I tried to make scplay as easy to use as possible. When firing it up for the first time, you are asked for your
permalink profile ID, which you can extract from the permalink to you profile. My profile ID would be:

*http:// soundcloud.com/<span style="color:#f00">fe-lix-62</span>*

From there on, simply double-click your songs inside the list to play them. The application
will hide itself once you click elsewhere on the screen. To bring it back up, click on the icon in the systray.

## Version
To find out your version number, right-click the icon in your systray. Always be sure to make use of the latest one ;)

## Endorsement
At the moment of writing, I am not affiliated with or endorsed by SoundCloud.
I just put up their logo so that you do not forget that SoundCloud does the heavy lifting here.
